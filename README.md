# LCD1602-KiCad-Library

## LCD 1602 symbol, footprint and model for KiCad.

## How to install?
I don't know if there is any special way to install KiCad library (I mean place where files are supposed to be put), but I suggest to copy whole library directory to the project root directory and then import both symbols and footprints with models.

## Warning!
I'm not KiCad veteran, so if you think this file should be edited, let me know about it.
